About Number Guessing Game Project

Today we are going to create a Number Guessing Game. This game is about creating an interactive game that will display scores and a person has to guess the number. There will be hints displayed every time the user guesses a wrong number. The objective of creating this project is to challenge our brains and add some fun while learning python.

During the creation of the project, we are going to use two libraries-

1. Tkinter – Tkinter Module will help us create an easy GUI in python with lots of inbuilt functions that we will learn.

2. Random – We will use the Random Module to generate a random number that the user will be guessing. This number will only be known to the computer.
